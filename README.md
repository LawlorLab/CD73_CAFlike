This repository contains code used to generate figures in the article "Cancer-associated fibroblast-like tumor cells remodel the Ewing sarcoma tumor microenvironment"

R notebooks can be found in "src/", gene lists (including gene ontology and MSigDb lists used as well as gene lists output from these notebooks) are in "gene_lists/", and working data sources (excluding the single cell sequencing RDS objects which are too large to upload here) are in "working_data/". 

Raw data (RNA-seq FASTQ, GeoMx DSP FASTQ, 9 cell line CITE-seq) for these analyses is deposited at NCBI GEO GSE326289.
